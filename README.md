# ReadSortWriteFile

We need an application to sort students by their name. We expect that system UI will be written in Swing and allows user to select a text file with
student data, sorting algorithm and display result in table with an option to save it to a file.


As we are not sure how many students will have to be sorted, we would like you to implement Bubble, Heap and Merge sorting algorithms, but enable system
design to be easily extendable in future.


To simplify benchmarking we would like to see a number of records and sorting time.
Input file example:
```
Student1,8.5
Student2,6.5
Student3,5.0
```
